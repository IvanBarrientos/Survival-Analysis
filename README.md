# Survival-Analysis
survival analysis tools for Python

Currently
---------
Aalen additive method, very direct and basic implementation. 
Works well for small datasets and produces finite predictions for expected survival.

Warnings
--------
Current Aalen additive model fit algo is memory intensive and not optimized.
